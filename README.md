# Bitcoin-Buddy
Bitcoin Buddy is a python code that you can use to monitor bitcoin prices in real time.
The foundation of this project is the creation of IFTTT (“if this, then that”) applets. We will learn how to use the requests library to send HTTP requests and how to use a webhook to connect your app to external services. Being able to check this program would make Investment easier, being able to see the price of bitcoin down to the millisecond. Since these cryptos and stocks are all in one convenient location, we will use this Python program to help us determine when is the time to invest. Since it is already tracking the current rate that the stocks/crypto is at, we can determine if the price of bitcoin is going down or rising in real time. This lets the user decide if it is a good time to invest in bitcoin or sell their bitcoin. You can also use bitcoin buddy with other cryptos if you change the code to for example, litecoin.
