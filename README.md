# Bitcoin-Buddy
Bitcoin Buddy is a python code that you can use to monitor bitcoin prices and determine the best time to invest in or sell your cryptocurrency.
The foundation of this project is the creation of IFTTT (“if this, then that”) applets. We will learn how to use the requests library to send HTTP requests and how to use a webhook to connect your app to external services. Being able to check this program would make Investment easier, having all of your potential investments in one central location. Since these cryptos and stocks are all in one convenient location, we will use this Python program to help us determine when is the time to invest. Since it is already tracking the current rate that the stocks/crypto is at, we can implement code that tells us when a good time is to invest, when is an okay time to invest, and when we shouldn’t invest. The user could also use this algorithm to determine when the best times are to sell their cryptocurrency if they are looking to sell.
